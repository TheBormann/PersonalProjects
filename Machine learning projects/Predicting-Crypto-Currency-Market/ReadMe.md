# Crypto Currecny Price Predictions
This folder holds my findings about the connection between the ETF and Crypto-Currency market.
The ETF data will be gathered from www.justetf.com and the crypto currency from www.coingecko.com.
Coingecko even has a free API.

Websites I coulde use:
* https://www.finanzen.net/indizes/alle
* https://www.coingecko.com/en/api
* https://www.justetf.com/de-en/find-etf.html?sortField=weekReturnCUR&orderDir=desc&groupField=index&sortOrder=asc&tab=rollreturn
