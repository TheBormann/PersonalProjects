# Data collection

There are many different sources of data and ways to gather them.
For now we will concentrate on gathering data from the web. The most simple way to get data is from dataset providers like:

* Kaggle
* Quandl
* Data.world
* UCI Machine Learning Repository

Alternatively gathering data from different sources, called web scraping is used whenever there is no dataset already
available or additional data is needed.\
Python provides different web-scraping libraries, like Beautiful soup, Selenium or Scapy.
